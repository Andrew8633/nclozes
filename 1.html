    The Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act)[a] is a European Union regulation concerning artificial intelligence (AI).

It establishes a common regulatory and legal framework for AI in the European Union (EU).[1] Proposed by the European Commission on 21 April 2021,[2] it passed the European Parliament on 13 March 2024,[3] and was unanimously approved by the EU Council on 21 May 2024.[4] The Act creates a European Artificial Intelligence Board to promote national cooperation and ensure compliance with the regulation.[5] Like the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, the Act can apply extraterritorially to providers from outside the EU, if they have users within the EU.[6]

It covers all types of AI in a broad range of sectors; exceptions include AI systems used solely for military, national security, research and non-professional purposes.[7] As a piece of product regulation, it does not confer rights on individuals, but regulates the providers of AI systems and entities using AI in a professional context.[6] The draft Act was revised following the rise in popularity of generative artificial intelligence systems, such as ChatGPT, whose general-purpose capabilities did not fit the main framework.[8] More restrictive regulations are planned for powerful generative AI systems with systemic impact.[9]

The Act classifies non-exempted AI applications by their risk of causing harm. There are four levels – unacceptable, high, limited, minimal – plus an additional category for general-purpose AI. Applications with unacceptable risks are banned. High-risk applications must comply with security, transparency and quality obligations and undergo conformity assessments. Limited-risk applications only have transparency obligations and those representing minimal risks are not regulated. For general-purpose AI, transparency requirements are imposed, with additional evaluations when there are high risks.
